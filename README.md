## What is this?
This is a project made for Database Technology course. It's a simple website made using PHP to show the tables from a database in PostgreSQL on an Azure VM. You can do Create, Read, Update, and Delete actions on the website. The changes you make on the website applies to the database.

## How to use the App?
Just go to gigadatabasetech.online/Bookstore or 20.121.18.251/Bookstore. You will get access to the website.

## Security?
Not much security is implemented here. Security is not my number one concern for this project.
[Fun Fact: This project got SQL Injectioned once, resulting in me losing control of the PostgreSQL. The attacker demanded a ransom of 0.008 BTC. But guess what? All of the data on the table are not important. They're all generated by ChatGPT :p]
